# RcppQueues

## Fast Event Queues and Lookup for Discrete Event Simulation

* This package is designed to test and prototype fast event queues as part of the MASH (Module Analysis & Simulation for Human Health) project, found here: http://smitdave.github.io/MASH-Development/index.html
* Initially work will focus on better implementation of Human Event Queues.
* Source code will be in C++ taking advantage of STL data structures, and will use `RcppR6` to expose C++ classes as R6 objects in R.
