# RcppQueues

## Fast Event Queues and Lookup for Discrete Event Simulation

* This package is designed to test and prototype fast event queues as part of the MASH (Module Analysis & Simulation for Human Health) project, found here: http://smitdave.github.io/MASH-Development/index.html
* Initially work will focus on better implementation of Human Event Queues.
